DFA Builder
===========

This allows building a DFA representing a simple game.


## TODO

+ Create logic to check for errors
  + Unreachable states
  + Inescapable loops / dead-ends 
  + Unusable transitions (those out of end states)
  + States with no text
  
+ Create undo / redo logic
  + Add redo logic

+ Improve the algorithm for positioning new states?
